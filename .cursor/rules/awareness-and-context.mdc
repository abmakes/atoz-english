### ðŸ”„ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isnâ€™t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.
- When a problem is resolved that comes from package or version compatibility issue add a note to the bottom of **`Tasks.md`** stating the issue and how to solve it eg. **`Issue: PixiJs v6 code not compatible with Zustand. Solution: Update Pixi Code to v7 as per documentation`**
