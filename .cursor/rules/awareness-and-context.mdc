### ðŸ”„ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `/project_docs`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `project_docs\09_TASKS.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isnâ€™t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `00_OVERVIEW.md`.
- When a problem is resolved that comes from package or version compatibility issue add a note to the bottom of **`08_LESSONS_LEARNED.md`** stating the issue and how to solve it eg. **`Issue: PixiJs v7 code not compatible with Zustand. Solution: Update Pixi Code to v8 as per documentation`**
