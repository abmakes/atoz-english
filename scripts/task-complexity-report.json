      "taskTitle": "Implement AssetLoader and ControlsManager",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of AssetLoader and ControlsManager into 6 specific subtasks, focusing on separating the core functionality of each component, their integration with the engine, and testing. Include initialization, core methods, event handling, and documentation for each.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating two core components with multiple responsibilities. The AssetLoader requires asset loading, caching, progress tracking, and error handling. The ControlsManager needs input handling, event mapping, and configuration. Both components require careful integration with the engine architecture and event system."

      "taskTitle": "Implement RuleEngine and PowerUpManager",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the implementation of RuleEngine and PowerUpManager into 7 concrete subtasks, separating the core rule processing system, condition evaluation, action execution, power-up state management, and integration with other engine components. Include testing and documentation subtasks.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the rule processing system requiring condition evaluation and action execution logic. The PowerUpManager needs state tracking and duration management. Both components have multiple dependencies and need to integrate with the event system. The rule prioritization and configuration aspects add additional complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Refactor PixiEngine Core Orchestrator",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the PixiEngine core orchestrator refactoring into 7 specific subtasks, focusing on initialization of manager components, game loop implementation, lifecycle management, error handling, and integration testing. Include subtasks for documentation and performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "This is a high-complexity task as it involves orchestrating all manager components and handling the entire game lifecycle. The PixiEngine is the central component that ties everything together, requiring careful integration of multiple systems. It has dependencies on all previous tasks and needs to manage initialization, updates, rendering, and cleanup of resources."

      "taskTitle": "Refactor MultipleChoiceGame Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the MultipleChoiceGame refactoring into 5 specific subtasks, focusing on implementing the BaseGame interface, migrating existing functionality to use the new managers, integrating with the event system, implementing rule definitions, and comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves refactoring an existing game to use the new engine architecture. While complex, it's primarily integration work rather than creating new systems. The challenge lies in properly migrating functionality to use the new managers and ensuring the game works correctly with the new event-driven approach."

      "taskTitle": "Update React UI Layer Integration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the React UI integration update into 4 specific subtasks, focusing on GameConfig creation and passing, event subscription and handling, component lifecycle management with proper cleanup, and testing the integration between React and the Pixi engine.",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on updating the React components to work with the new engine architecture. It's moderately complex as it involves creating proper GameConfig objects, handling engine events, and ensuring proper cleanup. The integration between React and the Pixi engine requires careful attention to component lifecycles."

      "taskTitle": "Comprehensive Testing and Documentation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the testing and documentation task into 6 specific subtasks, focusing on unit testing for individual managers, integration testing for the complete system, performance testing, architecture documentation, API documentation, and creating usage examples and guidelines.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves comprehensive testing and documentation of the entire engine architecture. It requires creating test suites for all components, verifying interactions, and documenting the architecture. The complexity comes from the breadth of coverage needed and the importance of thorough documentation for future development."
