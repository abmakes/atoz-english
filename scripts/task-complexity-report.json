    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Implement RuleEngine Basics",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the RuleEngine implementation into subtasks covering: core class structure, event-condition-action processing loop, rule registration/management, integration with EventBus, and testing with basic game logic scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a fundamental component with complex logic for event processing, condition evaluation, and action triggering. The RuleEngine needs to handle dynamic rule registration and integrate with the EventBus, requiring careful architecture to ensure extensibility and performance."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Develop AudioManager with Basic Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the AudioManager implementation into subtasks covering: Howler.js integration, core audio control methods, resource management for sounds, and RuleEngine event binding for automatic sound triggering.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating a third-party library (Howler.js) and implementing standard audio functionality. The complexity is moderate as it requires proper resource management and event handling, but the audio operations themselves are relatively straightforward."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Refine ControlsManager for Unified Input Handling",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the ControlsManager enhancement into subtasks covering: keyboard input handling, mouse/touch input capture, input-to-action mapping system, and EventBus integration for standardized events.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires handling multiple input types (keyboard, mouse, touch) and creating a unified system to map these inputs to standardized game actions. The complexity comes from ensuring consistent behavior across different input methods and proper event emission."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create Reusable PixiJS UI Button Component",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Button component implementation into subtasks covering: basic button structure and appearance, state management (normal/hover/pressed/disabled), ControlsManager integration, and accessibility features.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a reusable UI component has moderate complexity due to the need to handle different states, styling options, and accessibility requirements. The integration with ControlsManager adds some complexity, but the scope is well-defined and focused on a single component."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Enhance AssetLoader with Spritesheet Support",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the AssetLoader enhancement into subtasks covering: spritesheet loading implementation, sprite extraction methods, asset path structure standardization, and error handling for different asset types.",
      "reasoning": "Extending the AssetLoader involves moderate complexity as it requires handling different asset types and implementing proper loading/error management. The spritesheet functionality adds some technical challenges, but the overall task has a clear scope and builds on existing functionality."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Animation and Math Utilities",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the utilities implementation into subtasks covering: basic math functions (vectors, collision), easing/interpolation functions, tweening system for sprite animation, chainable animation sequences, and integration with PixiJS ticker.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple utility functions for animation and math operations. The complexity comes from implementing various algorithms for easing, interpolation, and collision detection, as well as creating a flexible animation system that works with the PixiJS ticker."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate Enhanced Components with BaseGame",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the BaseGame integration into subtasks covering: interface updates for new components, initialization and lifecycle management, event handling system, component interaction orchestration, and helper methods for common game operations.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity as it requires coordinating multiple components (RuleEngine, AudioManager, ControlsManager) within the BaseGame architecture. Ensuring proper initialization, lifecycle management, and clean component interactions requires careful design and implementation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Update MultipleChoiceGame to Use New Components",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the MultipleChoiceGame refactoring into subtasks covering: RuleEngine integration for game logic, AudioManager integration for sound effects, ControlsManager implementation for player input, UI updates with new Button components, and animation enhancements for transitions and feedback.",
      "reasoning": "Refactoring an existing game to use the new components has moderate to high complexity. It requires understanding the current implementation and carefully replacing components while maintaining game functionality. Each integration point (RuleEngine, AudioManager, etc.) presents its own challenges."

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement AI Quiz Generation Service",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the AI service implementation into subtasks covering: API integration setup, prompt template design, response parsing logic, error handling and retry mechanisms, caching implementation, and backend endpoint creation with parameter handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the integration with external AI services, designing effective prompts, and parsing unstructured AI responses into structured quiz data. It requires handling API rate limits, authentication, error cases, and implementing caching for performance."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Create Quiz Form AI Input UI",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Quiz Form enhancement into subtasks covering: UI design for AI generation fields, API integration with the backend service, loading state and progress indication, error handling and user feedback, and preview/editing functionality for generated content.",
      "reasoning": "Enhancing the Quiz Creation form involves moderate complexity as it requires frontend-backend integration, handling asynchronous operations, and providing a good user experience during the generation process. The UI needs to handle loading states, errors, and allow for editing of AI-generated content."
