# Status: done

# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a reusable Button component for PixiJS that integrates with the ControlsManager
# Details:
Create a Button class in the /lib/pixi-engine/ui/ directory that extends PixiJS Container. Implement customizable appearance (background, text, hover/active states). Add support for different button states (normal, hover, pressed, disabled). Integrate with ControlsManager to emit PLAYER_ACTION events when clicked/tapped. Include accessibility features (keyboard focus, ARIA attributes). Support theming through configurable styles. Implement proper event cleanup on button destruction.

# Test Strategy:
Test button rendering, state changes (hover, press, disable), and event emission. Verify integration with ControlsManager by confirming PLAYER_ACTION events are emitted on interaction. Test accessibility features and keyboard navigation.
