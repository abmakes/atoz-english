# Description: Enhance the Quiz Creation form with AI generation capabilities
# Details:
Update the Quiz Creation form to include AI generation fields. Add input fields for topic, educational level, number of questions, and optional examples. Implement a 'Generate with AI' button that calls the AI service endpoint. Create a loading state for the generation process. Implement logic to populate the form with AI-generated content while allowing teacher editing. Add error handling and feedback for failed generation attempts. Include a preview mode to review generated content before saving.

# Test Strategy:
Test the UI flow from input parameters to generated content. Verify form population with AI-generated content. Test editing capabilities after generation. Validate error handling and user feedback. Test across different browsers and device sizes.
