# Title: Create Theme Configuration System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement central THEMES mapping object in src/lib/themes.ts for consistent theme application.
# Details:
Create a themes.ts file with a THEMES mapping object. Define theme properties including CSS class, asset paths, color schemes, and PixiJS-specific configurations. Implement functions for retrieving theme properties by ID. Add default theme fallbacks. Create TypeScript interfaces for theme configuration. Document the theme structure and how to add new themes.

# Test Strategy:
Test theme retrieval with various theme IDs. Verify fallback to default theme when an unknown ID is provided. Test all theme property accessors. Ensure type safety with TypeScript interfaces.
