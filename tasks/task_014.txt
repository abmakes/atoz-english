# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Analyze and optimize assets for MultipleChoiceGame, creating lower-fidelity versions for Optimized Mode.
# Details:
Audit all assets used by MultipleChoiceGame. Optimize images using WebP format and appropriate compression. Create spritesheets for related images to reduce requests. Compress audio files to appropriate quality levels. Create lower-fidelity versions of all assets for Optimized Mode. Establish naming conventions for optimized assets. Document file size reductions and quality trade-offs.

# Test Strategy:
Compare file sizes before and after optimization. Visually inspect optimized assets for quality issues. Test loading times with original vs. optimized assets. Verify all optimized assets render correctly in-game.
