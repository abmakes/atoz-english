# Task ID: 8
# Title: Update MultipleChoiceGame to Use New Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the MultipleChoiceGame to leverage all the enhanced engine components
# Details:
Refactor the MultipleChoiceGame implementation to fully utilize the enhanced engine components. Update the game to use RuleEngine for scoring and game logic. Integrate AudioManager for sound effects on correct/incorrect answers and game events. Implement ControlsManager for handling player input through keyboard and UI buttons. Replace existing UI elements with the new PixiJS UI Button components. Utilize animation utilities for smoother transitions and feedback. Ensure the game properly follows the BaseGame interface.

# Test Strategy:
Test the complete game flow with the new components. Verify scoring through RuleEngine works correctly. Test sound effects trigger appropriately. Validate input handling through keyboard and UI buttons. Test animations and transitions for smoothness and correctness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement BaseGame Abstract Methods in MultipleChoiceGame [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update MultipleChoiceGame to properly extend BaseGame and implement all required abstract methods
### Details:
1. Modify MultipleChoiceGame class to extend BaseGame
2. Implement required abstract methods: initialize(), update(), reset(), pause(), resume()
3. Move initialization logic from constructor to initialize() method
4. Ensure proper cleanup in destroy() method
5. Test each lifecycle method individually to verify correct behavior
6. Verify game can be properly initialized, paused, resumed and reset

## 2. Refactor State Management Using BaseGame's State System [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Replace existing state management with BaseGame's built-in state system
### Details:
1. Identify all game states in current implementation (e.g., loading, ready, playing, gameOver)
2. Create corresponding state constants in MultipleChoiceGame
3. Replace direct state variable assignments with this.setState() calls
4. Update state checking logic to use this.getState() instead of direct variable access
5. Implement state change listeners where needed using onStateChange()
6. Test state transitions to ensure game flow remains intact
7. Verify all UI updates correctly respond to state changes

## 3. Integrate RuleEngine for Scoring and Game Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Replace hardcoded scoring and game rules with the RuleEngine component
### Details:
1. Create rule definitions for scoring (correct/incorrect answers)
2. Define rules for game progression (e.g., level advancement, game completion)
3. Initialize RuleEngine in the initialize() method
4. Replace direct score manipulation with RuleEngine.applyRule() calls
5. Update game logic to use RuleEngine for determining game outcomes
6. Add listeners for rule application events to update UI
7. Test scoring with various answer scenarios
8. Verify game progression rules work correctly

## 4. Implement AudioManager for Sound Effects [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Add sound effects for game events using the AudioManager component
### Details:
1. Initialize AudioManager in the initialize() method
2. Define sound assets for different game events (correct answer, incorrect answer, game start, game over)
3. Add audio triggers on appropriate game events
4. Implement sound for correct/incorrect answers
5. Add background music support if applicable
6. Add volume control integration
7. Test all sound effects trigger at appropriate times
8. Verify sounds play correctly on different game events

## 5. Replace UI Elements with PixiJS UI Button Components [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Update all UI elements to use the new PixiJS UI Button components
### Details:
1. Identify all clickable UI elements in the current implementation
2. Replace each element with the appropriate PixiJS UI Button component
3. Configure button appearance for different states (normal, hover, pressed)
4. Update event listeners to use the button's built-in events
5. Ensure proper button positioning and sizing
6. Implement button animations for feedback
7. Test all buttons for proper interaction and visual feedback
8. Verify accessibility features of buttons work correctly

## 6. Integrate ControlsManager for Input Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.5
### Description: Implement ControlsManager to handle player input through keyboard and UI
### Details:
1. Initialize ControlsManager in the initialize() method
2. Define control mappings for keyboard inputs (e.g., number keys for answers, space for continue)
3. Register UI button events with ControlsManager
4. Update event handling to use ControlsManager.on() for input events
5. Implement keyboard shortcuts for game actions
6. Add support for alternative input methods if applicable
7. Test keyboard and button inputs work correctly
8. Verify input handling works consistently across different game states

## 7. Implement Animation Utilities for Transitions and Feedback [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.5
### Description: Add smooth animations for game transitions and player feedback
### Details:
1. Identify opportunities for animations (question transitions, feedback, score updates)
2. Implement animations for correct/incorrect answer feedback
3. Add transitions between questions using animation utilities
4. Create animations for game state changes (start, end)
5. Implement score change animations
6. Ensure animations are properly cleaned up when not needed
7. Test all animations for smoothness and timing
8. Verify animations enhance rather than hinder gameplay
