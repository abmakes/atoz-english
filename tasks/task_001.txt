# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement RuleEngine Basics
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the fundamental event-condition-action processing loop within RuleEngine for basic game logic
# Details:
Create the RuleEngine class with methods for registering rules, processing events, and triggering actions. Implement the core event->condition->action processing loop that evaluates conditions and executes corresponding actions. Include methods for adding/removing rules dynamically. Rules should support basic game logic like scoring adjustments triggered by events. Ensure the RuleEngine properly interfaces with the EventBus to listen for relevant game events and emit action events when rules are triggered.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for rule registration, condition evaluation, and action execution. Test with mock events to verify correct rule triggering. Validate integration with EventBus by testing complete event->rule->action flows.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define RuleEngine class structure and interfaces [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic structure of the RuleEngine class with interfaces for Rule, Condition, and Action components
### Details:
1. Create a Rule interface/class with properties for conditions and actions
2. Define a Condition interface that evaluates game state and returns boolean
3. Define an Action interface that executes changes to game state
4. Create the RuleEngine class with storage for rules collection
5. Add methods for rule registration (addRule) and removal (removeRule)
6. Test by creating simple rule instances and verifying they can be added/removed from the engine

## 2. Implement event processing and condition evaluation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Develop the core mechanism to process incoming events and evaluate rule conditions
### Details:
1. Add an event processing method (processEvent) that takes an event as input
2. Implement logic to iterate through all registered rules
3. For each rule, evaluate its condition against the current event and game state
4. Create a filtering mechanism to quickly identify rules relevant to specific event types
5. Add logging for condition evaluation results
6. Test by creating mock events and conditions, verifying conditions evaluate correctly

## 3. Implement action execution mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create the system to execute actions when conditions are met
### Details:
1. Extend the processEvent method to execute actions when conditions evaluate to true
2. Implement action execution that can modify game state
3. Add support for multiple actions per rule
4. Implement error handling for action execution
5. Add logging for action execution
6. Test by creating rules with mock conditions (always true) and verifying actions execute properly

## 4. Integrate RuleEngine with EventBus [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Connect the RuleEngine to the EventBus to listen for game events and emit action events
### Details:
1. Add EventBus dependency to RuleEngine
2. Implement event subscription method to register for relevant game events
3. Update processEvent to handle EventBus event format
4. Add method to emit action events back to the EventBus
5. Implement initialization logic to subscribe to events when RuleEngine starts
6. Test by verifying RuleEngine properly receives events from EventBus and emits action events

## 5. Implement basic game logic rules [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Create sample rules for common game logic scenarios like scoring and state changes
### Details:
1. Implement a ScoreRule class that extends Rule for point-based scoring
2. Create a StateChangeRule class for game state transitions
3. Add factory methods to RuleEngine for creating common rule types
4. Implement rule prioritization to control execution order
5. Add rule categories/tags for organization
6. Test with integration tests that verify complete event-condition-action flow with realistic game scenarios (e.g., player collects item → condition checks item type → action awards appropriate points)
