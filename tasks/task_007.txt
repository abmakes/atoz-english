# Task ID: 7
# Title: Integrate Enhanced Components with BaseGame
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the BaseGame interface and implementation to use the refined managers and utilities
# Details:
Update the BaseGame interface to include methods for utilizing the enhanced managers and utilities. Modify the abstract BaseGame class to properly initialize and use RuleEngine, AudioManager, ControlsManager, and animation utilities. Implement standard game lifecycle methods (init, update, destroy) that handle proper setup and teardown of all components. Create helper methods for common game operations that leverage the new utilities. Ensure proper event handling and subscription management.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test implementation of BaseGame to verify proper initialization and usage of all managers. Test game lifecycle methods to ensure proper setup and cleanup. Validate event handling and subscription management through the game lifecycle.
