# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop AudioManager with Basic Functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a basic AudioManager using Howler.js for sound effects and music in the game
# Details:
Create the AudioManager class that integrates with PixiEngine. Use Howler.js for audio handling. Implement core methods: registerSound, play, stop, setVolume, and mute/unmute. Configure the manager to load default sounds from '/public/audio/default/' (correct.mp3, incorrect.mp3, etc.). Add event listeners to connect with RuleEngine for automatic sound triggering on game events. Ensure proper resource management (loading/unloading sounds) and error handling for missing audio files.

# Test Strategy:
Test sound registration, playback, and volume controls. Verify integration with RuleEngine by triggering game events and confirming appropriate sounds play. Test error handling with missing audio files and edge cases.
