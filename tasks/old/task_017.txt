# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Engine UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create reusable PixiJS UI components for the engine.
# Details:
Implement common UI components in the /lib/pixi-engine/ui/ directory. Create Button, Panel, Label, ProgressBar, and other reusable components. Ensure components work with the AssetLoader and follow a consistent style. Support theming and customization.

# Test Strategy:
Test component rendering, interaction, and customization. Verify components work correctly with the engine and AssetLoader.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Base UI Component Class and Simple Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation UI component class and implement basic components like Button and Label
### Details:
1. Create a base `UIComponent` class in `/lib/pixi-engine/ui/UIComponent.js` that handles common functionality:
   - Position and size management
   - Event handling (click, hover, etc.)
   - Theme integration
   - Basic lifecycle methods (init, update, destroy)

2. Implement `Button` component in `/lib/pixi-engine/ui/Button.js`:
   - Extend the base UIComponent
   - Support different states (normal, hover, pressed, disabled)
   - Handle click events with callbacks
   - Support text and/or icon display
   - Include customization options (colors, borders, etc.)

3. Implement `Label` component in `/lib/pixi-engine/ui/Label.js`:
   - Text rendering with configurable font, size, color
   - Support for text alignment and wrapping
   - Optional background and borders

4. Create a simple demo that shows these components in action

Testing approach:
- Create unit tests for each component verifying proper rendering
- Test event handling for buttons
- Test different configuration options
- Verify theme integration works correctly

## 2. Implement Container and Layout Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create Panel, ScrollView, and layout management components
### Details:
1. Implement `Panel` component in `/lib/pixi-engine/ui/Panel.js`:
   - Container for other UI components
   - Configurable background, borders, and padding
   - Support for different shapes (rectangle, rounded rectangle)
   - Optional header/title area

2. Implement `ScrollView` in `/lib/pixi-engine/ui/ScrollView.js`:
   - Container that supports scrolling content that exceeds its bounds
   - Implement scroll bars (vertical and horizontal)
   - Support for mouse wheel and drag scrolling
   - Mask/clip content to the visible area

3. Create layout utilities in `/lib/pixi-engine/ui/layouts/`:
   - `GridLayout`: Arrange components in a grid
   - `StackLayout`: Stack components vertically or horizontally
   - `FlexLayout`: Flexible layout with grow/shrink capabilities

4. Update the demo to showcase these container components

Testing approach:
- Test proper containment and positioning of child elements
- Verify scrolling works with different input methods
- Test layout algorithms with various component sizes
- Ensure proper event propagation through container hierarchy

## 3. Implement Interactive and Themed Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2
### Description: Create ProgressBar, Slider, Checkbox components and implement theming system
### Details:
1. Implement `ProgressBar` component in `/lib/pixi-engine/ui/ProgressBar.js`:
   - Visual representation of progress (0-100%)
   - Configurable colors, direction (horizontal/vertical)
   - Optional labels and tick marks

2. Implement `Slider` component in `/lib/pixi-engine/ui/Slider.js`:
   - Interactive component for selecting a value in a range
   - Draggable handle and track
   - Event callbacks for value changes

3. Implement `Checkbox` component in `/lib/pixi-engine/ui/Checkbox.js`:
   - Toggle control with checked/unchecked states
   - Support for labels and custom icons

4. Create a comprehensive theming system in `/lib/pixi-engine/ui/Theme.js`:
   - Define theme structure (colors, fonts, sizes, etc.)
   - Implement default theme
   - Add methods to apply themes to all components
   - Support for custom/user themes

5. Integrate with AssetLoader to handle UI assets (icons, textures)

6. Create a complete demo showcasing all components with theme switching

Testing approach:
- Test interactive components with various input scenarios
- Verify value changes and event callbacks work correctly
- Test theme application across all components
- Ensure proper asset loading and management
- Test performance with many components on screen
