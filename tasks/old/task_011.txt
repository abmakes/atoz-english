# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement StorageManager
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the StorageManager to handle data persistence.
# Details:
Implement StorageManager.ts with localStorage implementation. Include methods for saving/loading game state, settings, and scores. Add abstraction layer to potentially support API-based storage in the future. Implement data versioning and migration support.

# Test Strategy:
Test saving and loading various data types. Verify data persistence across page reloads. Test error handling for storage quota exceeded.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create StorageManager base class with localStorage implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core StorageManager class with basic localStorage functionality for saving and loading data
### Details:
1. Create a new file StorageManager.ts
2. Define a StorageManager class with an interface for basic storage operations
3. Implement methods for saving and loading data using localStorage:
   - save(key: string, data: any): void
   - load(key: string): any
   - delete(key: string): void
   - clear(): void
4. Add error handling for localStorage operations
5. Implement type safety with generics for data retrieval
6. Add utility methods for checking if data exists
7. Test the basic functionality by saving and loading simple objects

## 2. Add game-specific storage methods and abstraction layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Extend StorageManager with game-specific methods and create an abstraction layer for future storage backends
### Details:
1. Create an IStorageProvider interface that defines the required methods for any storage implementation
2. Refactor the localStorage implementation to implement this interface
3. Add game-specific methods to StorageManager:
   - saveGameState(state: GameState): void
   - loadGameState(): GameState
   - saveSettings(settings: GameSettings): void
   - loadSettings(): GameSettings
   - saveScores(scores: ScoreData[]): void
   - loadScores(): ScoreData[]
4. Implement proper namespacing for different data types to avoid key collisions
5. Add a factory method to potentially create different storage providers (localStorage, sessionStorage, etc.)
6. Test the game-specific methods with mock game data

## 3. Implement data versioning and migration support [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Add versioning to stored data and implement a migration system for handling data structure changes
### Details:
1. Modify the data storage format to include version information
2. Create a VersionedData interface that wraps any stored data with version metadata
3. Implement a MigrationManager class that can transform data between versions
4. Add migration registration system where migrations can be defined as transformations between specific versions
5. Update the save/load methods to automatically handle versioning:
   - When saving, add the current version number
   - When loading, check the version and apply necessary migrations
6. Add backward compatibility checks
7. Implement a method to purge outdated data formats
8. Test the migration system with sample data transformations between different versions
