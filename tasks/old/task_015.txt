# Task ID: 15
# Title: Update PixiWrapper React Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the PixiWrapper React component to initialize PixiEngine with GameConfig.
# Details:
Modify the existing PixiWrapper component to initialize the new PixiEngine with a complete GameConfig. Handle React props to PixiEngine communication. Set up event listeners for engine events that need to update React state. Implement proper cleanup on unmount.

# Test Strategy:
Test initialization with various configurations. Verify React-to-Engine and Engine-to-React communication works correctly. Test component lifecycle and cleanup.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Modify PixiWrapper to initialize PixiEngine with GameConfig [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the PixiWrapper component to accept GameConfig as props and initialize the PixiEngine instance with this configuration.
### Details:
1. Update the PixiWrapper component to accept GameConfig as a prop
2. Create a reference to hold the PixiEngine instance using useRef
3. In the useEffect hook, initialize the PixiEngine with the GameConfig prop
4. Pass the container ref to the PixiEngine for mounting
5. Test that the PixiEngine initializes correctly with different GameConfig values
6. Ensure backward compatibility if GameConfig is not provided
7. Add PropTypes validation for the GameConfig prop

## 2. Implement React props to PixiEngine communication [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Set up a system to pass React props to the PixiEngine and handle prop changes efficiently.
### Details:
1. Create a useEffect hook that watches for changes in relevant props
2. Implement methods to update the PixiEngine when props change
3. Add debouncing or throttling if needed for performance-sensitive props
4. Create a mapping between React props and PixiEngine configuration
5. Test that prop changes correctly update the PixiEngine state
6. Handle edge cases like undefined props or props with special types
7. Document which props can be updated after initialization and which require re-initialization

## 3. Set up event listeners and implement cleanup [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Add event listeners for PixiEngine events that need to update React state and ensure proper cleanup on component unmount.
### Details:
1. Identify PixiEngine events that should trigger React state updates
2. Implement event listeners in the useEffect hook
3. Create state variables and update functions for each relevant engine event
4. Implement a comprehensive cleanup function in the useEffect return callback
5. Ensure all event listeners are removed on unmount
6. Properly destroy the PixiEngine instance on unmount
7. Test the component for memory leaks using React DevTools
8. Verify that all resources are properly released when the component unmounts
