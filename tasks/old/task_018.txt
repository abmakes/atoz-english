# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Engine Utility Functions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create utility functions for common engine operations.
# Details:
Implement utility functions in the /lib/pixi-engine/utils/ directory. Include functions for animation, math, object pooling, collision detection, and other common operations. Create type definitions and documentation for all utilities.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each utility function. Verify correct behavior with various inputs and edge cases.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Math and Animation Utility Functions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create utility functions for mathematical operations and animations in the engine.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a `/lib/pixi-engine/utils/math.ts` file with functions for:
   - Vector operations (add, subtract, multiply, normalize)
   - Angle calculations (degrees/radians conversion, rotation)
   - Random number generation with configurable ranges
   - Interpolation functions (linear, cubic, etc.)
2. Create a `/lib/pixi-engine/utils/animation.ts` file with functions for:
   - Easing functions (ease-in, ease-out, etc.)
   - Tweening helpers
   - Animation sequence management
   - Frame-based animation utilities
3. Create TypeScript interfaces and type definitions for all functions
4. Add JSDoc comments for all functions with parameters and return types
5. Write unit tests for each utility function

Testing approach:
- Create test cases for edge cases in math functions
- Test animation functions with different timing parameters
- Verify correct behavior of interpolation and easing functions

## 2. Implement Object Pooling and Resource Management Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Create utility functions for object pooling and resource management to optimize performance.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a `/lib/pixi-engine/utils/object-pool.ts` file with:
   - Generic object pool implementation
   - Functions to create, get, and release objects
   - Pool size management and expansion policies
   - Memory usage optimization strategies
2. Create a `/lib/pixi-engine/utils/resource-manager.ts` file with:
   - Asset loading and caching utilities
   - Resource reference counting
   - Memory management helpers
   - Texture and audio resource optimization
3. Create TypeScript interfaces for pool configuration and resource management
4. Add comprehensive documentation with usage examples
5. Implement stress tests for object pools

Testing approach:
- Test object pool performance under high-frequency get/release operations
- Verify memory usage patterns with different pool configurations
- Test resource loading with various asset types and sizes
- Ensure proper cleanup of resources when no longer needed

## 3. Implement Collision Detection and Physics Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Create utility functions for collision detection and basic physics calculations.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a `/lib/pixi-engine/utils/collision.ts` file with:
   - AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection
   - Circle collision detection
   - Polygon collision detection
   - Spatial partitioning helpers (quadtree, grid)
2. Create a `/lib/pixi-engine/utils/physics.ts` file with:
   - Velocity and acceleration calculations
   - Basic physics simulation helpers
   - Gravity and friction utilities
   - Collision response functions
3. Create an index.ts file that exports all utility functions
4. Add detailed documentation with visual examples where appropriate
5. Create integration tests showing how these utilities work together

Testing approach:
- Test collision detection with various object shapes and positions
- Verify correct collision response in different scenarios
- Test performance with large numbers of objects
- Create visual tests to demonstrate collision detection working correctly
