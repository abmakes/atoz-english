# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement PixiEngine Core Orchestrator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main PixiEngine class to orchestrate all managers and game instances.
# Details:
Implement PixiEngine.ts as the main orchestrator. Initialize and hold references to all manager instances. Handle game lifecycle (init, update, render, destroy). Process the GameConfig to set up managers. Manage the current BaseGame instance. Implement the main game loop and PixiJS integration.

# Test Strategy:
Test initialization with various configurations. Verify all managers are properly instantiated and connected. Test game lifecycle methods and error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define PixiEngine Class Structure and Interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core PixiEngine class with its basic structure, interfaces, and type definitions needed for the orchestrator.
### Details:
1. Create PixiEngine.ts file with the class definition
2. Define interfaces for GameConfig and any other required types
3. Define class properties for storing manager references
4. Create placeholder methods for lifecycle management (init, update, render, destroy)
5. Define the interface for BaseGame that will be managed by the engine
6. Set up proper TypeScript typing for all components
7. Test by creating an instance and checking type safety

## 2. Implement Manager Initialization and Registration [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create the system for initializing and storing references to all manager instances within the PixiEngine.
### Details:
1. Implement methods to register different manager types (AssetManager, SceneManager, etc.)
2. Create storage for manager instances as protected properties
3. Implement getter methods to access managers safely
4. Add validation to prevent duplicate manager registration
5. Create initialization sequence for managers with proper dependency order
6. Add error handling for missing required managers
7. Test by registering mock managers and verifying they can be retrieved

## 3. Implement GameConfig Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Create the system to process the GameConfig object and use it to configure the engine and its managers.
### Details:
1. Define the complete GameConfig interface with all possible configuration options
2. Implement a method to process the config and apply settings to the engine
3. Add validation for required config properties
4. Create a system to pass relevant config sections to appropriate managers
5. Implement default values for optional config properties
6. Add configuration for PixiJS renderer options
7. Test by creating various config objects and verifying they're processed correctly

## 4. Implement Game Instance Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Create the system for managing the current BaseGame instance, including initialization, updates, and switching between games.
### Details:
1. Implement methods to set the current game instance
2. Create the game initialization sequence
3. Add methods to safely start, pause, resume and stop the current game
4. Implement game switching functionality with proper cleanup
5. Create event system for game state changes
6. Add validation to prevent invalid game state transitions
7. Test by creating mock game instances and verifying lifecycle methods are called correctly

## 5. Implement Main Game Loop [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.4
### Description: Create the core game loop that handles updates and rendering at the appropriate intervals.
### Details:
1. Implement the main game loop using requestAnimationFrame
2. Add delta time calculation for consistent updates
3. Create update and render methods that cascade to managers and the current game
4. Implement frame rate limiting options
5. Add performance monitoring (FPS counter, timing statistics)
6. Create pause/resume functionality for the game loop
7. Test by running the loop and verifying consistent timing and proper method calls

## 6. Implement PixiJS Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.3, 13.5
### Description: Integrate PixiJS renderer and stage management within the engine orchestrator.
### Details:
1. Initialize PixiJS Application based on config
2. Set up the main stage and container hierarchy
3. Implement render methods that utilize PixiJS renderer
4. Add resize handling for the canvas
5. Create methods to access and manipulate the stage
6. Implement WebGL feature detection and fallbacks
7. Test by creating a simple rendering scenario and verifying visual output

## 7. Implement Complete Lifecycle Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6
### Description: Finalize the engine with complete lifecycle management including initialization, updates, and proper cleanup.
### Details:
1. Create a comprehensive initialization sequence
2. Implement proper shutdown and cleanup procedures
3. Add resource management and garbage collection triggers
4. Implement error handling throughout the lifecycle
5. Create debug mode with additional logging
6. Add event system for engine lifecycle events
7. Test the complete lifecycle with integration tests that verify all components work together properly
