# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Create or update the GameplayView component to configure and launch games.
# Details:
Implement GameplayView.ts to handle game setup, configuration, and launching. Create a comprehensive GameConfig based on quiz data and user settings. Pass configuration to PixiWrapper. Handle game events and state updates from the engine.

# Test Strategy:
Test configuration generation with various quiz data. Verify game launching and event handling. Test user interaction and state updates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create GameplayView component structure and GameConfig interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic structure of the GameplayView component and define the GameConfig interface that will be used to configure games based on quiz data and user settings.
### Details:
1. Create GameplayView.ts file with a React functional component.
2. Define props interface including quiz data, user settings, and callback functions for game events.
3. Create the GameConfig interface with properties for game settings (e.g., difficulty, time limits, question data).
4. Implement the component's basic structure with placeholder sections for configuration controls and game display area.
5. Set up initial state variables to track game status (not started, in progress, completed).
6. Test the component renders correctly with mock props and displays basic UI elements.

## 2. Implement game configuration and PixiWrapper integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Add functionality to transform quiz data and user settings into a GameConfig object and integrate with PixiWrapper to launch games.
### Details:
1. Implement a function to transform quiz data and user settings into a complete GameConfig object.
2. Add the PixiWrapper component as a child component in the GameplayView.
3. Create a mechanism to pass the generated GameConfig to PixiWrapper when a game should be launched.
4. Implement UI controls for users to adjust game settings before launching.
5. Add a 'Start Game' button that triggers game initialization with the current configuration.
6. Test the configuration generation with various quiz data inputs.
7. Verify the PixiWrapper receives the correct configuration and initializes properly.

## 3. Implement game event handling and state management [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Set up event listeners for game events from the engine and implement state management to track game progress and results.
### Details:
1. Define event handler functions for all possible game events (game start, question answered, game over, etc.).
2. Pass these event handlers to the PixiWrapper component.
3. Implement state updates based on received game events.
4. Add UI elements to display current game state (score, progress, time remaining).
5. Implement end-game logic to show results and provide options to replay or return to menu.
6. Add animations or transitions between different game states for better UX.
7. Test the full game flow from configuration to completion.
8. Verify all game events are properly captured and reflected in the UI.
9. Test edge cases like game interruption, invalid configurations, or unexpected events.
