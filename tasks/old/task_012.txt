# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Basic RuleEngine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the RuleEngine with basic event handling capabilities.
# Details:
Implement RuleEngine.ts with event-driven rule processing. Support basic rules for phase transitions, scoring, and timer modifications. Create a simple rule definition format. Include methods to register, evaluate, and trigger rules based on game events.

# Test Strategy:
Test rule registration, evaluation, and execution. Verify rules trigger correctly based on events and conditions. Test interaction with other managers.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create RuleEngine class with event system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core RuleEngine class with event registration, subscription, and dispatching capabilities
### Details:
1. Create RuleEngine.ts file with a class that manages game rules
2. Define interfaces for Rule, RuleEvent, and EventHandler types
3. Implement methods for event registration (registerEvent)
4. Add methods to subscribe to events (on, once)
5. Create event dispatching mechanism (emit/trigger)
6. Implement basic event queue processing
7. Test by creating simple events and verifying they trigger appropriate handlers

## 2. Implement rule definition and registration system [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create a system for defining rules in a structured format and registering them with the RuleEngine
### Details:
1. Define a structured format for rule definitions (JSON-like structure)
2. Create interfaces for different rule types (PhaseRule, ScoreRule, TimerRule)
3. Implement rule registration method (registerRule)
4. Add rule validation to ensure proper format
5. Create rule storage within the RuleEngine
6. Implement rule lookup by ID or type
7. Test by defining sample rules and verifying they can be registered and retrieved

## 3. Implement rule evaluation and execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Create the logic to evaluate rule conditions and execute rule actions based on game events
### Details:
1. Implement rule condition evaluation logic
2. Create action execution system for different rule types
3. Connect event system to rule evaluation
4. Implement specialized handlers for phase transitions, scoring, and timer modifications
5. Add methods to evaluate all applicable rules for a given event
6. Create priority system for rule execution order
7. Implement rule chaining (rules that trigger other rules)
8. Test with complex scenarios involving multiple rule types and events
