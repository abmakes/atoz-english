# Task ID: 20
# Title: Enhance RuleEngine with JSON Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend RuleEngine to support JSON-based rule configuration.
# Details:
Enhance RuleEngine to support loading rules from JSON configuration. Define a comprehensive rule schema with conditions, actions, and triggers. Implement rule parsing, validation, and execution. Support complex conditions and action sequences.

# Test Strategy:
Test rule loading from JSON, validation, and execution. Create test rule sets covering various game scenarios. Verify rule interactions and priority handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define JSON Schema for Rule Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive JSON schema that defines the structure for rule configuration including conditions, actions, and triggers.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a JSON schema that supports rule definitions with properties for rule ID, name, description, enabled status, and priority.
2. Define the structure for conditions including comparison operators (equals, greater than, less than, contains, etc.), logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), and value types (string, number, boolean, array).
3. Define the structure for actions including action type, parameters, and sequence order.
4. Define trigger specifications (events that activate rule evaluation).
5. Include support for nested conditions and condition groups.
6. Document the schema with examples for different rule types.
7. Test the schema by validating sample JSON rule configurations against it.

Testing approach:
- Create sample JSON files with various rule configurations
- Validate them against the schema using a JSON schema validator
- Ensure the schema supports all required rule components and complexity levels

## 2. Implement JSON Rule Parser and Validator [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Create a parser that can load, parse, and validate JSON rule configurations according to the defined schema.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a RuleParser class that can load JSON from files or strings.
2. Implement schema validation to verify that loaded JSON conforms to the schema defined in subtask 1.
3. Add error handling for malformed JSON, schema violations, and logical inconsistencies.
4. Create data models/classes that represent parsed rules in memory (RuleDefinition, Condition, Action, Trigger classes).
5. Implement a method to convert JSON rule definitions into these model objects.
6. Add validation for business logic (e.g., circular references, invalid condition combinations).
7. Implement logging for parsing and validation processes.

Testing approach:
- Unit test the parser with valid and invalid JSON inputs
- Test error handling with malformed JSON
- Verify that validation correctly identifies schema violations
- Ensure the parser correctly transforms JSON into rule model objects

## 3. Extend RuleEngine to Execute JSON-Configured Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2
### Description: Enhance the RuleEngine to load, evaluate, and execute rules defined in JSON configuration.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Extend the existing RuleEngine to accept rule definitions from the JSON parser.
2. Implement a rule registry to manage loaded rules (add, remove, enable/disable, prioritize).
3. Create a condition evaluator that can process the complex conditions defined in JSON (including nested conditions and logical operators).
4. Implement an action executor that can run actions in sequence as defined in the JSON configuration.
5. Add support for rule triggers to determine when rules should be evaluated.
6. Implement rule execution context to maintain state during rule evaluation and execution.
7. Add performance monitoring and metrics collection for rule execution.
8. Create a simple API to load rule configurations at runtime.

Testing approach:
- Unit test condition evaluation with various condition types and combinations
- Test action execution with different action types and parameters
- Integration test the full rule execution flow from JSON to actions
- Performance test with multiple rules of varying complexity
- Test dynamic loading and updating of rules at runtime
