# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Targeted Load Speed Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Focus on lazy loading, code splitting, and initialization optimization for MultipleChoiceGame.
# Details:
Implement lazy loading for non-essential assets. Add code splitting to separate MultipleChoiceGame code from other game types. Optimize initialization sequence to prioritize critical assets. Implement progressive loading with visual feedback. Add asset preloading for anticipated game transitions. Measure and optimize time-to-interactive metrics specifically for MultipleChoiceGame.

# Test Strategy:
Measure load times before and after optimization. Test progressive loading with throttled network conditions. Verify game functionality is not affected by optimization changes. Test on various devices to ensure consistent improvements.
