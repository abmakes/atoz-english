# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Basic Power-Up System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a simple power-up feature that can be used across game types.
# Details:
Implement PowerUpManager methods for registering, activating, and managing power-up duration. Create a basic power-up (e.g., "Extra Time" or "Hint") that works across game types. Add visual indicators for active power-ups. Implement power-up collection/activation mechanics. Integrate with RuleEngine for power-up effects. Add appropriate sound effects and animations for power-up activation.

# Test Strategy:
Test power-up registration and activation. Verify effects are applied correctly when activated. Test duration management and expiration. Ensure visual indicators accurately reflect power-up status.
